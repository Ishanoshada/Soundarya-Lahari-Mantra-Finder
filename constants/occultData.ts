            "<strong>Vedic Law:</strong> As you sow, so shall you reap. Using this knowledge to harm, manipulate, or control others for selfish gain will create negative karma that will inevitably return to you, bringing suffering and misfortune.",
            "<strong>Buddhist Law:</strong> Unwholesome intentions (rooted in greed, hatred, and delusion) lead to suffering for oneself and others. Using this knowledge inflates the ego and creates attachments, deepening the cycle of rebirth and suffering (Samsara).",

Those who want to perform these practices for misuse or merely for personal gain through self-interest will never attain siddhi (mastery). If they do, it will quickly be destroyed, which can cause harm to the practitioner. The mantras given in this book will only be mastered by those whose conduct is pure, whose heart is pure, and who are free from vices like arrogance, and who want to master them only for the benefit of others.",
            "I have no extensive experience in the subject of Tantra-Mantra, nor do I know whether all the mantras written in the book are true or false. Still, I have tried to present this subject as I have seen it with my own eyes, giving a few examples, and I will request the readers that if they want to gain authority in this science, they should do so with a spirit of renunciation and for the purpose of public welfare, not out of selfishness or greed. Otherwise, it will be a deception, and in the end, you will have to repent.",

            `"Mantra, Yantra, and Tantra" - these three words are of Vedic Sanskrit. Therefore, some people believe that the practice of Mantrik, Yantrik, and Tantrik arts originated from the Vedic period. However, my estimation is that these three subjects were prevalent even before the Vedic period. If historians consider tribes like the Kol, Bhil, and Dravidian peoples to be pre-Vedic, then even today, those people perform their practices (sadhana) according to their own language and customs. And it need not be said that they achieve more immediate success compared to the so-called "civilized" communities. Any person can go to the region of Gondwana even now and witness this firsthand.`

            "Although most mantras in the Vedas are abundant, they are all composed for the welfare of the self, this world, and the next. They are the greatest and are proponents of the supreme element [God]. Or you could say that they possess such power that they can subdue even the absolute and unassailable Brahman to fulfill one's desires. Therefore, a mantra can be called that influential word or group of words, the systematic chanting (japa) of which leads to the success of the desired work.",
            "Although not all mantras are Vedic, some were created long after the Vedic period, and in them, prayers or requests are made to deities like 'Devi, Hanuman, Bhairav,' etc. However, readers or practitioners should never forget that all these gods and goddesses - whether divine or demonic - are but partial powers of the one formless, all-powerful, all-virtuous Parabrahma.",
            "It is a natural law for all living beings that for any task, one uses as much of a limb or power as is deemed necessary. For instance, to see, only the opening of the eyes is required. If the scene is not visible upon opening the eyes, meaning it is in a place where one cannot reach, then one must also use the feet. In some tasks, the hands, feet, eyes, ears, etc., all sense organs are involved. In some, only the intellect is used, and in others, only the soul.",
            "The point is that power is used according to the nature of the task. All these powers belong to the complete Brahman (God), and it is easily achievable to gain authority over a part of it, in equivalence to the whole. Therefore, the masters of mantras have created mantras only of the various powers of God. With mantras made in the name of the complete Brahman, the entire universe can be conquered and He can be attained. For that purpose, it is not considered necessary to use them for these small tasks.",
            "The rule prescribed for any experiment or action is called Tantra. The Yantra by which the desired work is accomplished should be understood as a Tantric Yantra. The relationship between Yantra, Tantra, and Mantra is as intimate as that of metal, knowledge, and skill in operating a machine. Just as a machine cannot run without all three, so too is the desired work impossible to accomplish without these three.",

In my opinion, you would prefer the second method. This will not take much time, and there is no possibility of any harm in gaining experience. In this way, in 'Mantra Vidya,' the means that ancient acharyas have discovered and presented to the world in an amazing form, by working according to them, we can easily achieve success.",

But a prayer made with a selfish motive against someone's will is not a prayer, but rather a way to pressure them, to bring them under control, and to get them to do work according to one's own will. That is why such prayers are named 'mantra'. Now you yourself consider, if we try to force someone to work, will they easily accept bondage? Never. A small mistake on your part, and you will slip from their hands, and it is possible that you may also be harmed in some way."

Along with this, it is also mandatory to follow all those rules completely and literally, which are given with the mantra regarding that mantra's subject.",

Just as the effect of electric power falls on another electric power, in the same way, the power of the soul, by casting its influence on another soul, makes it one with itself.
