            "This review article explores Daivavyapasraya Chikitsa (soul therapy) in Ayurveda, focusing on Beej Mantras as sacred seed sounds that connect the individual to divine energy for healing. The study involved 48 first-year students at PEC Chandigarh who underwent a one-hour guided Beej Mantra meditation session. Pre- and post-meditation measurements tracked physiological parameters like weight, blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SPO2), body mass index (BMI), systolic BP (BPS), diastolic BP (BPD), and pulse pressure (BPP) using paired t-tests and ANOVA for analysis.",
            "Key findings showed significant reductions in mean pulse rate and BP, with students reporting increased attentiveness, relaxation, better memory, and a fun learning atmosphere. For example, systolic BP increased slightly post-meditation (from 106.54 to 119.21, p=0.002), but overall, stress indicators improved. Beej Mantras were explained as vibrations that activate chakras and nourish body tissues (Dhatus), balancing Doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) per Ayurvedic principles—e.g., soft mantras for Vata calming.",
            "The conclusion affirms Beej Mantra meditation as a simple, effective tool for stress reduction and health enhancement in students, rooted in Ayurveda's mind-body-soul framework. It calls for wider studies on disorders like COVID-19, emphasizing mantras' inexplicable (Prabhavajanya) effects on psychic and physical health."

            "This narrative review synthesizes recent randomized controlled trials on mantra meditation (MM), prioritizing objective measures like EEG, fMRI, and heart rate variability (HRV) over self-reports. It analyzes MM's effects on stress, anxiety, hypertension, and immunity, excluding spiritual aspects.",
            "Methods involved reviewing high-quality trials, such as those on Transcendental Meditation (TM) and \"Om\" chanting, using tools like the Perceived Stress Scale and physiological sensors. Findings indicate strong stress relief (e.g., increased galvanic skin response), moderate hypertension management (reducing systolic BP by ~4 mmHg), and inconclusive anxiety/immunity benefits. Specific to Beej/Bija mantras, \"Om\" and \"Ham\" showed stress reduction via GSR increases and immunity boosts through higher salivary IgA levels.",
            "Conclusions recommend MM for stress and blood pressure control but urge more rigorous studies with larger samples. Practically, this supports using Beej Mantras like \"Om\" in daily routines for cardiovascular health, aligning with Ayurveda's sound therapy."

Dudeja cites the Vedas, noting sound as the primal vibration of creation (Brahm), transforming into healing energy when chanted with intent. Known as \"japa\" (muttering), this practice induces \"restful alertness,\" aligning bodily vibrations to cure energy blockages. Scientific evidence includes synchronized brain hemispheres, improved oxygenation, and reduced heart rate and blood pressure, effects measurable with modern tools like EEG."]
