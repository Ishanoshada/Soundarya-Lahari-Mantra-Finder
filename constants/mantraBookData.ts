      "In the Vedas the mantra (sound) is the primary source from which the universe has sprung (in the Bible: \"in the beginning it was the Verb\"); it is the primordial vibration presents in every thing, the motor of the universe. Through the study and the search on the mantras the ancient wise men have discovered how we can be in harmony with the cosmos and with ourselves.",
      "ॐ (Aum) it is the primordial sound, is the matrix of all that exists in the universe. it doesn't have a particular meaning, it is rather a sacred syllable that represents the essence of the vital energy from which the creation has sprung. ॐ is the combination of three sounds: A - U - M. The A represents Brahma the creator, the conscience, the state of vigil. The U represents Vishnu the preserver, the subconscious, the state of dream. The M represents Shiva the destroyer, the unconscious, the state of deep sleep.",
      "The utilization of the sounds for spiritual purpose is universally used. In a lot of religions, the continuous repeating of a sentence or a sacred sound with the help of a rosary (japa mala) represents the highest form of meditation. The mantras are the best vehicle in the meditation because through them the mind calms the incessant flow of thoughts and it settles in a state of deep concentration."

    transliteration: [],
    meaning: [ "Shabar mantras are mantras pronounced in the languages and dialects of India rather than in the traditional language of yoga, Sanskrit. These mantras were mainly prepared by Nath Sampradaya and Indian tribal peoples. Unlike many of his Sanskrit cousins, the Shabar Mantras are not sung by the energy of their sound vibrations, but by their meaning in the local language, though sometimes the words used in them are such that the mantras seem completely devoid of meaning. In most cases they do not require any kind of purity, fixed ritual, correct grammar etc. Shabar Mantras are extremely powerful because they do not have Keelak. Keelak means block, limit. It seals the power of a Mantra and can only be unlocked after completing a certain number of chants. Since the Shabar Mantras do not have a Keelak, the Mantras begin to show their power from the first Mala. Many immediately feel this wave of energy feeling overwhelmed and feeling a strong fear. For their enormous power the Shabar Mantras are not suitable for everyone but only for spiritually advanced devotees." ],
