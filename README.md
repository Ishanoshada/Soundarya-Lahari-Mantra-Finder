## Core Spiritual Concepts

The application draws from three distinct and powerful sources of Sanatana Dharma:

### 1. Soundarya Lahari ("Waves of Beauty")
A revered text of 100 verses (slokas) attributed to the great saint **Adi Shankaracharya**. It is a cornerstone of the **Shri Vidya** tradition, celebrating the beauty and power of the Divine Mother, Goddess Shakti. The text is divided into two parts:
- **Ananda Lahari (Verses 1-41):** The "Waves of Bliss," focusing on the esoteric aspects of Shri Yantra worship and the blissful, cosmic union of Shiva and Shakti.
- **Soundarya Lahari (Verses 42-100):** The "Waves of Beauty," which exquisitely describes the physical and divine form of the Goddess from head to toe.

Each verse is a potent mantra, believed to grant specific spiritual and material benefits when recited with devotion.

### 2. Infallible Vedic Remedies
A curated collection of powerful mantras and practices sourced from the authoritative book by **Swami Shantananda Puri**. This section offers time-tested remedies for a wide range of life's challenges, from health issues and mental well-being to finding a suitable partner and overcoming financial debts.

### 3. Secrets of Yantra, Mantra and Tantra
A compendium of selected practices from this classic text, offering a glimpse into the mystical sciences of:
- **Yantra:** Sacred geometric diagrams that serve as visual tools for concentration and as dwelling places for divine energy.
- **Mantra:** Sacred sounds or verses that carry specific vibrational energy to manifest intentions.
- **Tantra:** A systematic spiritual path that uses rituals, meditation, and the physical body to achieve spiritual realization.

- **Intention Selection:** You can also select one or more predefined intentions from a comprehensive list to guide your search.

### 2. Lookup Mantra or Sloka
- **Direct Access:** For those familiar with the text, you can directly search for a specific Soundarya Lahari sloka by its number (1-100) or its associated Bija Mantra (e.g., "Kleem").
- **Multi-Sloka View:** If a Bija Mantra is associated with multiple slokas, the application will display all of them, allowing for a comparative study.

### 3. Vedic Remedies & Mantra Compendium
- **Structured Browsing:** Explore a comprehensive list of remedies and tantric practices in a clean, two-pane layout.

## Understanding Bija Mantras

A **Bija (seed) mantra** is a single-syllable sound that holds a potent, concentrated form of divine energy. In traditions like Shri Vidya, these seed sounds are considered the acoustic roots of deities, elements, and cosmic forces. When chanted, they are believed to activate specific energies within the practitioner and the universe. The Soundarya Lahari is rich with these powerful mantras.

Below is a more comprehensive list of key Bija Mantras found within or related to the traditions in this application:

## Technical Architecture

This application is built with a modern frontend stack, deeply integrated with the Google Gemini API.

### Frontend Stack
- **React & TypeScript:** The UI is built using React for its efficient, component-based architecture. TypeScript provides robust type-safety, leading to more maintainable and error-free code.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and consistent styling directly within the JSX, ensuring a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.
- **html2canvas:** A powerful library used to implement the screenshot functionality, allowing DOM elements to be rendered onto an HTML5 canvas.

### Gemini API Integration
The `@google/genai` library is the core of the application's intelligence. The Gemini API is leveraged in several key ways:
- **Intelligent Search (`findMantraForProblem`):** The user's natural language query is sent to the Gemini model along with a condensed, relevant subset of the local data. The model is instructed to act as a Vedic scholar and return identifiers for the most appropriate remedies in a strict JSON format, enforced by a `responseSchema`. This is highly efficient as it avoids transferring the entire dataset over the network.
- **Deeper Analysis (`analyzeSlokas`, `explainBijaMantras`):** For deeper insights, the details of one or more slokas are sent to the model with a prompt asking for a specific type of analysis (e.g., a structured summary or a tabular explanation of Bija Mantras). The model's generative capabilities are used to synthesize new, insightful content based on the source material.
- **Dynamic Translation:** Textual content from the local data sources is sent to the Gemini model with a prompt to translate it into the user's selected language. This is done on-demand and cached in the component's state to avoid redundant API calls.
- **Conversational AI (`getAiChatResponse`):** For the AI Chat Guide, the model is given a system instruction to act as "Lahari GPT". The user's message and conversation history, along with a pre-filtered context of relevant local data, are sent in the prompt. This "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" (RAG) approach ensures the AI's responses are grounded in the application's knowledge base and relevant to the user's query.

### Data Strategy
All the core spiritual text data (`slokaData.ts`, `remediesData.ts`, etc.) is bundled locally within the application. This ensures that browsing and looking up specific items is instantaneous and works offline. The AI is then used as an intelligent layer *on top* of this local data for advanced searching, analysis, and translation, providing the best of both worlds: speed and intelligence.

## Getting Started (For Developers)

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser.
- A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ishanoshada/Soundarya-Lahari-Mantra-Finder.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Soundarya-Lahari-Mantra-Finder
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    This project expects the Gemini API key to be available as an environment variable. In a local development or server environment, you would typically create a `.env` file in the root of the project:
    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    The application code (`process.env.API_KEY`) will then pick this up. **Note:** To make `process.env` available in a simple client-side project, you'll need a bundler or development server (like Vite or Web Dev Server) that can inject these variables.

4.  **Run the application:**
    You can serve the `index.html` file using any simple local server. For example, using Python's built-in server:
    ```bash
    # For Python 3
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
    Or using a Node.js package like `serve`:
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    ```
    Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` or `http://localhost:3000`).
