## Core Spiritual Concepts

The application draws from a rich tapestry of distinct and powerful sources of spiritual wisdom:

### 1. Soundarya Lahari ("Waves of Beauty")
A revered text of 100 verses (slokas) attributed to the great saint **Adi Shankaracharya**. It is a cornerstone of the **Shri Vidya** tradition, celebrating the power of the Divine Mother, Goddess Shakti. Each verse is a potent mantra, believed to grant specific spiritual and material benefits.

### 2. Infallible Vedic Remedies
A curated collection of powerful mantras and practices sourced from the authoritative book by **Swami Shantananda Puri**. This section offers time-tested remedies for a wide range of life's challenges, from health issues to financial debts.

### 3. Mantra by Govinda Das Aghori
A comprehensive collection of mantras sourced from the book "Mantra," with translations by Govinda Das Aghori. This compendium covers a wide array of categories, including foundational Bija Mantras, detailed hymns to deities like Ganesh and Gayatri Devi, and mantras for specific purposes, offering a broad spectrum of practices.

### 4. Secrets of Yantra, Mantra and Tantra
A compendium of selected practices from this classic text, offering a glimpse into the mystical sciences of:
- **Yantra:** Sacred geometric diagrams that serve as visual tools for concentration.
- **Mantra:** Sacred sounds or verses that carry specific vibrational energy.
- **Tantra:** A systematic spiritual path that uses rituals and meditation to achieve spiritual realization.
- **Herbal Remedies:** The use of specific plants and roots for physical and spiritual well-being.

### 5. Buddhist Chanting (Pāli Canon)
A collection of essential chants from the Pāli Canon, as found in the "Buddhist Chanting Book in Pāli and English." This section provides a direct connection to the teachings of the Buddha.

## Feature Walkthrough: A Step-by-Step Journey

This application is a multi-faceted spiritual toolkit. Here’s how to get the most out of your experience.

### Step 1: Start with Your Intention
The primary way to begin is through the **AI-Powered Search**. In the "Find Mantra for Problem" section, simply describe your situation or need in the search bar. Use natural language, as if you were asking a wise guide for help.

- **Examples:** "I need help focusing on my studies," "mantra for courage before an interview," or "remedy for financial difficulties."
- **Combine Feature:** You can check the "Combine mantras" box. This tells the AI to find 2-3 practices from different sources that work *synergistically* together for a more powerful, multi-faceted approach.

The Gemini AI will analyze your query and search across all spiritual libraries to find the most relevant recommendations.

### Step 2: Explore the AI's Recommendations
The AI may return a single, highly relevant practice or a collection of synergistic ones. The results are presented in a clear, expandable format. You can click on each recommendation to open a detailed card without leaving the page.

### Step 3: Dive Deeper into a Practice
Each mantra, remedy, or chant is displayed on a detailed content card.
- **Immersive Full-Screen Mode:** For focused practice, click the full-screen icon on any card to enter a distraction-free view.
- **AI-Generated Deeper Insights:**
  - **Explain Bija Mantra:** For Soundarya Lahari slokas, this feature provides an AI-generated analysis of the Bija Mantra(s), including associated deities, chakras, and benefits, in a clear table.
  - **Analyze Sloka:** Get a concise, structured analysis of a sloka's core purpose, its key spiritual connections, and actionable guidance.

### Step 4: Build Your Personal Sadhana (Practice)
As you find practices that resonate with you, you can build a personalized routine using the powerful bookmarking system.
- **Bookmark an Entire Practice:** Click the "Bookmark for Sadhana" button on any card to add the entire item to your list.
- **Bookmark Specific Sections:** For deeper personalization, you can bookmark individual sections within a card (e.g., just the "Transliterated Mantra" or the "Mode of Worship"). This is perfect for creating a focused, step-by-step practice guide.

### Step 5: Manage, Synthesize, and Share Your Practice
Once you have bookmarked items, a floating panel appears with powerful tools:
- **Manage Your List:** Quickly review your selections. You can easily remove individual items or use the **"Clear All"** button to reset your practice list.
- **AI-Powered Mantra Creation:** If you have bookmarked multiple Soundarya Lahari slokas, you can use the **"Create Combined Mantra"** feature. The AI will analyze the Bija Mantras from your selections and synthesize a new, potent mantra, complete with a name, purpose, and chanting guidance.
- **Shareable Links:** From the "Bookmark & Share" menu, you can generate a unique URL. This link saves all your bookmarked items—including the specific sections you've chosen—and your language preference. You can save this link for later or share your curated practice with others.

### Step 6: Explore the Libraries Directly
Use the navigation buttons at the top to explore each spiritual library individually.
- **Lookup Sloka, Vedic Remedies, Mantra Compendium, etc.:** Each section features a clean, two-pane layout. The left panel contains a searchable and filterable list of all practices, while the right panel displays the detailed content card for your selection. This is ideal for browsing, learning, and discovering new practices.

### Step 7: Immerse Yourself in Sound

- **Advanced Audio Player:** Each track has an elegant audio player with an animated visualizer, download options, and bookmarking capabilities.
- **Ambient Background Music:** Create a serene atmosphere for your practice by choosing from a selection of ambient background tracks using the music player in the bottom-left corner.

### Step 8: Connect with the Wisdom
- **AI Chat Guide:** Engage with "Lahari GPT," a conversational AI spiritual guide. Its knowledge is grounded exclusively in the texts contained within this application, ensuring relevant, context-aware responses to your questions.

### Step 9: Bridge Ancient Wisdom with Modern Science
- **Research Summaries:** Explore a dedicated section that provides comprehensive, well-explained summaries of key scientific studies on Beej/Bija Mantra meditation and its effects on health and well-being.

### Universal Features
- **Multilingual Support:** Key information is translated by the Gemini API into multiple languages, including English, Sinhala, Tamil, Hindi, and Malayalam.
- **Screenshot Capture:** Capture and share beautiful, watermarked images of any mantra card, explanation, analysis popup, or even the entire application view with a single click.

## Technology Stack & Architecture

This application is built with a modern frontend stack and is deeply integrated with the Google Gemini API to deliver its intelligent features.

### Frontend
- **Framework:** **React** with **TypeScript** for a robust, type-safe, and component-based architecture.
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first approach that enables rapid, consistent, and responsive UI development.
- **User Experience:** The application is designed to be a Progressive Web App (PWA) for a seamless, native-like experience. It includes features like a full-screen mode for immersive practice, an audio visualizer, and ambient background music to create a focused spiritual environment.

### AI & Machine Learning: Google Gemini API
The core intelligence of the application is powered by the `@google/genai` library, leveraging different capabilities of the Gemini models:

- **Intelligent Search (`findMantraForProblem`):** The user's natural language query is sent to the Gemini model along with a condensed, structured representation of the local spiritual text data. The model is instructed to act as a spiritual scholar and return only the unique identifiers of the most relevant practices in a strict JSON format, which is enforced by a `responseSchema`.
- **Deeper Analysis & Synthesis (`analyzeSlokas`, `createCombinedMantra`):** For deeper insights, details of user-selected items are sent to the model with a prompt asking it to perform a specific task, such as providing a structured analysis of a sloka's meaning or creatively synthesizing a new, combined mantra with a name, purpose, and chanting guidance.
- **Dynamic Translation:** Textual content from local data sources is sent to the Gemini model for on-demand, context-aware translation into multiple languages. This allows the app to be accessible to a global audience without needing to store pre-translated text.
- **Conversational AI (`getAiChatResponse`):** The "AI Chat Guide" uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The model is given a system instruction defining its persona ("Lahari GPT") and is provided with a pre-filtered context of relevant local data based on the user's query, along with the conversation history. This ensures the AI's responses are grounded in the application's specific knowledge base, preventing hallucinations and providing relevant, helpful guidance.

### Data Strategy
A hybrid data strategy ensures both performance and intelligence:
- **Local Data:** All core spiritual text data is bundled locally within the application. This allows for instantaneous browsing and lookups, ensuring the core library features are fast and work offline.
- **AI as an Intelligent Layer:** The Gemini API is used as an intelligent layer *on top* of this local data for advanced searching, analysis, translation, and conversation, providing dynamic capabilities that would be impossible with a static dataset.

### Third-Party Libraries
- **`html2canvas`:** A powerful library used to implement the screenshot functionality, allowing users to capture and share beautiful, watermarked images of mantras, analyses, or the entire application view with a single click.
